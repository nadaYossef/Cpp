# Cpp
In this repo , I decided to improve my c++ skills with building a few simple projects.

My first C++ project is about hotel management system in which user is able to choose some options they have a query about.
My second C++ project is about building login interface in which user can either sign in if they have an account already, they can sign up if they do not have an account, or use the option "Forgot Password" to change thier passwords so that they're able to access thier account again
